# Model?

What is a **Model**?

Generally, it is a way to calculate something that is more complicated than a equation.

Should it be a file? Perhaps. Could it be a python object? Of course.

In **Pinferencia**, a model is just a piece of codes that can get called. A function, or an instance of a class just like those pytorch models.
